The "squared" Moodle Theme
======================

The theme is generally based on squares. If you like squares, that is definitely your first choice, if you do not like squares, 
you might consider it as well, because it looks really good ;-).

The idea of this theme is to put design in first place, and then see if it can be done technically. This is the first theme most of
the users do not recognize it was made for moodle ;-). The authors even pretend that it is the most beautiful theme ;-). 

About the theme.
 - It uses a lot of squares: blocks are squared, some heading elements are squared and so on.
 - New icon set for moodle standard activities and plugins. If you want the source (vector), just contact info@edulabs.org
 - It is not yet responsive. If you would like it to have responsive, we are square enough to accept money to do that. Just write to info@edulabs.org
 - The frontpage slideshow is completely customizable concerning text and images. Changing animation style: you have to be a coder.
 - Your social icons appear as squares on the bottom of the theme
 - Blocks are collapsed per default
 - The theme uses the font Source Sans Pro from Adobe, which is optimised for web reading
 - There is a super dropdown custom menu. You can add categories to the custom menu. The menu adds all content of the category
   to the custom menu according to the rights of the user.
   Example setting in the general them settings /admin/settings.php?section=themesettings :
   My category name|http://example.com/moodle/course/index.php?categoryid=2
   My other category name|http://example.com/moodle/course/index.php?categoryid=1
   Third category name|http://example.com/moodle/course/index.php?categoryid=3
 - You are not allowed to copy the frontpage and colors of www.virtuelle-ph.at

Reporting issues
================
Before reporting an issue, please ensure that you are running the latest version for your release of Moodle.  It is important
that you are operating the required version of Moodle as stated at the top - this is because the theme relies on core
functionality that is out of its control.

When reporting an issue you can check he issue list https://github.com/dasistwas/moodle-theme_squared/issues and if the problem
 does not exist, create an issue.

It is important that you provide as much information as possible, the critical information being the contents of the theme's 
'version.php' file.  Other version information such as specific Moodle version, theme name and version also helps. A screen shot
can be really useful in visualising the issue along with any files you consider to be relevant.
